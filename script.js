const paragraph = `To Dearest Ananya,
I donâ€™t know where to begin because no words can truly capture what I feel for you. But if I donâ€™t say this now, I may regret it forever.
I love you.
I love you in ways that I canâ€™t explain, in moments I canâ€™t count, and in dreams I canâ€™t escape. From the first time I saw you, something in me changed. It wasnâ€™t just attractionâ€”it was something deeper, something that made me believe in fate. 
After seeing you once, is it even possible that I donâ€™t fall in love? 
I tried to ignore it, thinking it was just a fleeting feeling. But you never left my thoughts, my prayers, or my dreams. Every time I close my eyes, I see you. 
Without a doubt, today in your dreams, slowly can I walk by? 
Because in reality, I have been walking toward you every single day, hoping that one day, you would turn around and see me. 
I never believed in fairy talesâ€”until you. You made me believe in something greater, something magical. I donâ€™t know what I mean to you or if I mean anything at all, but to me, you are everything. You are the air I breathe, the thought that keeps me awake at night, the name that makes my heart race even in silence. 
You are my dream. But dreams alone arenâ€™t enough, are they? Thatâ€™s why every day, I push myself to become someone worthy of you. Every late night spent debugging, every challenge I overcome, every small victory I achieveâ€”itâ€™s all a step toward the future I dream of, a future where I can stand beside you, not just as someone who loves you, but as someone you can be proud of.
I wasnâ€™t meant to be a coder. Life pushed me into mechanical engineering, a world of machines, forces, and equations that never truly felt like mine. But somewhere along the way, I found my way back to what I lovedâ€”coding, problem-solving, creating something out of nothing. It wasnâ€™t easy, balancing two worlds, feeling like an outsider in both. But every time I wanted to give up, I reminded myself: "If I canâ€™t follow my heart in academics, at least I should follow it in love." So, I kept goingâ€”practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in stolen moments between mechanical assignments, debugging my own doubts late into the night, and pushing myself toward my dream of becoming a Software Development Engineer (SDE). Because for me, success isnâ€™t just about a careerâ€”itâ€™s about building a life where I can proudly stand beside you, where I can give you everything you deserve.
Ananya, my entire life has been about solving problems, finding the right logic, breaking things down until I find a solution. But youâ€¦ you are the only question I donâ€™t want to solve, the only mystery I want to get lost in forever. I have spent countless hours searching for patterns in code, but the pattern of my heart always leads to you. I have fixed memory leaks, optimized loops, and handled exceptionsâ€”but when it comes to you, I am the exception, the one error that no compiler can debug. I donâ€™t want a solution; I just want you.
I deleted your picture once, thinking if I ever got it back, maybe life would give me a sign. And now, I have it again. Maybe that means something. Maybe it means that no matter how hard I try to let you go, you are meant to stay. 
In the tent of a nomadâ€™s small little heart, could you be living all along?
I donâ€™t want to spend another day loving you in silence. I want you to know, to feel, to understand that my love isnâ€™t just wordsâ€”itâ€™s a promise. A promise that no matter what happens, I will always choose you. Even if the world turns against me, even if I have to wait a lifetime, I will wait. 
Because without you, my life is bereft. For you, my life is devoted. Without you, this lifeâ€”what is it? Just kill me. 
I donâ€™t know what you feel after reading this. Maybe you think Iâ€™m foolish. Maybe youâ€™ll forget these words as soon as you finish reading them. But if, even for a second, your heart racedâ€¦ if, even for a moment, you thought of me differentlyâ€¦ then that is all I need to keep believing.
Ananya, if there is even a 1% chance that you could ever love me back, then tell me. And if not, then let me love you from a distance. But know thisâ€” I will love you in every universe, in every lifetime, until the end of time. 
Forever yours,
Sathwik M S`;
